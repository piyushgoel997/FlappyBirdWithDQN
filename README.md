In this project I built a copy of the flappy bird game using pygame. Then I used [Deep Q Learning](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning/) to train a keras model to play the game and get the maximum score possible.  

You can also download the game and play it if you want.
